Our realization is based on the source code on https://github.com/WojciechMormul/deep-compression

 In this article, we investigate how to compress and accelerate the neural networks (NNs) in communication systems. After introducing the deployment challenges for DL-based communication algorithms, we discuss some representative NN compression and acceleration techniques. Afterwards, two case studies for multiple-input-multiple- output (MIMO) communications, including DL-based channel state information feedback and signal detection, are presented to show the feasibility and potential of these techniques. We finally identify some challenges on NN compression and acceleration in DL-based communications and provide a guideline for subsequent research.
